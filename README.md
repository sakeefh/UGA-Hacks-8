## Key Features
- Organizations can post volunteering opportunities for communities to sign up for. They are also able to enhance the visibility of the event they are hosting by adding custom tags that volunteers may filter for.
- Volunteers are able to discover and sign up for local volunteering opportunities and they can track their volunteer hours in the app.
- Users have a custom volunteer feed set to showcase opportunities that they set their preferences to.
 
## Challenges
- We were not able to populate our database properly. To overcome this, we implemented a systematic approach to data entry and retrieval. By refining our database schema and optimizing queries, we were able to enhance the efficiency of data population.
- We encountered syntax challenges with React Native. We utilized React Native documentation and Stack Overflow to gain insights into best practices.

## What's Next
- **Database Integration:**
  - Incorporate database functionalities for a more robust app.
- **Separate Logins for Organizations:**
  - Allow organizations to log in separately for better management.
- **Advanced Search:**
  - Implementing advanced search and filtering options for volunteering opportunities.
